# _Introduction_
  Fraudulent transactions pose a significant challenge to credit card companies and financial institutions. This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions accurately. By analyzing historical transaction data and identifying patterns indicative of fraudulent activities, the goal is to build a model that can classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

# _Dataset_
  The project utilizes a credit card transaction dataset for training and testing the fraud detection model. The dataset consists of 209,651 rows and 20 columns. It does not contain any null values or duplicate entries.

# _Objectives_
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

   1. Explore and preprocess the credit card transaction dataset.
   2. Understand the relationships between variables using visualization techniques.
   3. Perform feature engineering and data pre-processing to prepare the dataset for model training.
   4. Apply machine learning techniques to train a fraud detection model.
   5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
   6. Save the best predicted model for future use.
   7. These objectives outline the key steps involved in the project, including data exploration, visualization, pre-processing, model training, evaluation, and model saving.

# _Model Building_
  The dataset was analyzed using three different machine learning models: 
    Logistic Regression, 
    Random Forest Classifier
    AdaBoost Classifier. 
  Among these models, the Random Forest Classifier performed the best in terms of predicting credit card transaction fraud, achieving an accuracy score of 98%.

# Results
  The **Random Forest Classifier** demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions, achieving an accuracy score of **98%**. This model can serve as a valuable tool for credit card companies and financial institutions in detecting and preventing fraudulent activities.
